<h3><a href="https://github.com/AgustinPodhainy/UTN-FRBA-Academic-Projects/tree/main/2024/Sistemas%20Operativos">🖥️ C - Comenta (Operating Systems Project)</a></h3> 
A low-level C project that simulates a distributed system, handling process scheduling, memory management,  
and interprocess communication. Developed using Linux system calls and multithreading techniques.  

<h3><a href="https://github.com/AgustinPodhainy/UTN-FRBA-Academic-Projects/tree/main/2024/Dise%C3%B1o%20de%20Sistemas">🍽️ Food Access Management System</a></h3>  
A support system designed to improve food accessibility through a network of public refrigerators. It enables real-time monitoring of refrigerator statuses, donation tracking, and volunteer coordination to ensure efficient food distribution. The backend is developed in Java, using Javalin for API development and Hibernate for object-relational mapping. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an intuitive interface for users. We use MySQL as the database service, ensuring reliable data management.  
Additionally, we deployed the application using AWS, ensuring scalability and high availability.  
This project focuses on software architecture, API integration, and cloud deployment, providing a structured solution for food donation management.
